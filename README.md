# binarySearchTreeSim

Takes an input of numbers, and them creates a binary search tree printed to the console 
(Root starts on left and works its way to the right)

Should be noted that the program does not print binary search trees in the classic top-down format, 
with the root on the top and the leaves following underneath. Instead, the root is on the very left,
and the leaves follow to the right.

Also should be noted that I did not write the BinarySearchTree.java class. This was provided for the project by
the professor, Dr. Joseph Svitak
